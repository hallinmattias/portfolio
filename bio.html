    <h2>Who am I and why did i become a designer?</h2>
    <p>Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in creating and building stuff. It began with Lego and continued
      with electrical circuits and woodworking. I did not come as a surprise, to people close to me, when I decided to
      take on the studies to become an Industrial Design Engineer.

      During my studies I found a new area interest in design. By studying usability to improve the user experience I
      understood the importance of designing what the user needs instead of what the user wants. That sparked my
      interest of UX design.</p>
