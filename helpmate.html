        <h1>Strava Team Challenges</h1>
        <p><strong>What:</strong> App feature Challenge</p>
        <p><strong>When:</strong> January 2020- February 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> User Research / UX / UI</p>
        <p><strong>With:</strong> Jenny Ho & Jessi Li</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Photoshop, Ilustrator</p>
        <p>
            This project was a x week app feature case as a part of the the course IAT334 Interface Design provided by School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC.<br>
            
            The research phase was focused on understanding how the users use the app and why they choose it in favor of other apps to find its unique selling points. Many Strava users are attracted to the social platform that differs from its competitors. <br>
            
            Inside the app users can set goals and challenge each other on different challenges. Our work continued with ideation on how a new feature could benefit from the social platform to make the social interactions in the app even more attractive. Many features in the app that include interactions between users are competitive between the users.<br> 
            
            We wanted our feature to improve the social experience of the app and. Our final concept leveraged on the social platform and allowed the users work together instead of competing against each other. We call the feature Team Challenges. Users can group up and pick a fitting challenge to work on together.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Strava is a social fitness app that allows fitness enthusiasts to track their exercise progress and share fitness activities with friends. Users can use Strava to join clubs, complete challenges, find local events, and compare and share their activity with other users in their fitness network.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Strava brings athletes closer by sharing workout activities. However, most activities and challenges are completed individually, with social involvement only after you share a post or activity.</p>

        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <h3>Positive social motivation</h3>
        <p>Some athletes are motivated by knowing and seeing other people participating in the same activities, and through social feedback such as likes and comment on their activities.</p>
        <h3>Track Personal progress</h3>
        <p>Many athletes want to keep track of their personal progress. Some share their progress with their friends to receive social motivation, while others track it for personal motivation.</p>
