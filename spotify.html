        <p>This project was a part of the course xxx provided by the faculty of Design & Human Factors at Chalmers University, Gothemburg.</p>

        <p>The Purpose of the porject was to dig deep into the different features and functions of Spotifys iOS application in a Usability perspective to make it easier for the users to use regardless of previous app or technology experience. The goal of the project was to, from  user perspective, clarify the interface in Spotify app to increase the understandance of different functions for a more broad audience</p>
        
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Spotify iOS is a music streaming application built of multiple features and functions to allow streaming of desired music. The search function is used to find tracks, artists, albums etc. The service also allows the user to create and share different playlists. If the user want to avoid choosing song continually, without creating a playlist, it is possible to queue songs. Desired songs are found, added to the queue and plyed continuosly. The user has the possibility to edit the queue and when the queue is empty Spotify automaticly continues to play similar songs.</p>

        <h2>Theoretical evaluation</h2>

        <p>Multiple theoretical evaluation methods were used to find possible problems in the scenario of creating and listening to a playlist. Heuristic task analysis was made to map out the different parts of the interaction. A cognitive walkthrough and a predictive error analysis was carried out afterwards to get further into the details of the different sub goals. The results were used as a theoretical basis to to analyze the different errors a user might do in the different steps. The methods gave a concrete picture of the problems of the app and used as a basis for the empirical testing. The same methods were used on the re-design for validation purposes.</p>

        <h2>Empirical evaluation</h2>
        <p>The empirical evuluation started pilot study to confirm some of the results from the theoretical evaluation and provide more data for the design of the usability test. Multiple persons, both experienced and new users, were asked to explain the functions and consequences of different buttons and icons "Now Playing" interface as well as what the play queue is. The persons were also asked to grade on a scale from 1-5 on how sure they were.</p>
