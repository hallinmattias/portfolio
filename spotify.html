        <p>This project was a part of the course MMT031 Usability Engineering provided by the faculty of Design & Human Factors at Chalmers
            University, Gothemburg.</p>

        <p>The Purpose of the project was to dig deep into the different features and functions of Spotifys iOS
            application in a Usability perspective to make it easier for the users to use regardless of previous app or
            technology experience. The goal of the project was to, from user perspective, clarify the interface in
            Spotify app to increase the understandance of different functions for a more broad audience</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Spotify iOS is a music streaming application built of multiple features and functions to allow streaming of
            desired music. The search function is used to find tracks, artists, albums etc. The service also allows the
            user to create and share different playlists. If the user want to avoid choosing song continually, without
            creating a playlist, it is possible to queue songs. Desired songs are found, added to the queue and plyed
            continuosly. The user has the possibility to edit the queue and when the queue is empty Spotify automaticly
            continues to play similar songs.</p>

        <h2>Theoretical evaluation</h2>

        <p>Multiple theoretical evaluation methods were used to find possible problems in the scenario of creating and
            listening to a playlist. Heuristic task analysis was made to map out the different parts of the interaction.
            A cognitive walkthrough and a predictive error analysis was carried out afterwards to get further into the
            details of the different sub goals. The results were used as a theoretical basis to to analyze the different
            errors a user might do in the different steps. The methods gave a concrete picture of the problems of the
            app and used as a basis for the empirical testing. The same methods were used on the re-design for
            validation purposes.</p>

        <h2>Empirical evaluation</h2>
        <p>The empirical evuluation started pilot study to confirm some of the results from the theoretical evaluation
            and provide more data for the design of the usability test. Multiple persons, both experienced and new
            users, were asked to explain the functions and consequences of different buttons and icons "Now Playing"
            interface as well as what the play queue is. The persons were also asked to grade on a scale from 1-5 on how
            sure they were.</p>
